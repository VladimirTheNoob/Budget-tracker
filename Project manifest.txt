________________________________________
1. Define Requirements
Core Features:
•	Goal Management: 
o	Set goals by department.
o	Track goals' progress.
o	Filter goals by status, department, or deadline.
•	Task Management: 
o	Create tasks.
o	Set deadlines.
o	Assign tasks to employees.
o	Track task progress.
o	Filter tasks by assignee, department, or priority.
•	Budget Tracking: 
o	Assign budgets to goals.
o	Monitor budget utilization.
o	Notify managers about overspending.
•	Role-based Access Control (RBAC): 
o	Roles: Admin, Manager, Employee.
o	Permissions based on roles.
•	Authentication: 
o	Secure login and registration.
o	OAuth integration for SSO (e.g., Google, Microsoft).
•	Dashboard: 
o	Overview of goals, tasks, and budgets.
o	Visual analytics (charts, graphs).
•	Notifications: 
o	Alerts for deadlines, budget overruns, and updates.

2. Tech Stack
Frontend:
•	Framework: React.js (component-based, performant, and widely supported).
•	State Management: Redux Toolkit or React Context API.
•	Styling: Tailwind CSS or Material-UI (pre-built components for faster development).
•	Charts: Chart.js or D3.js (for visual analytics).
Backend:
•	Framework: Node.js with Express.js (lightweight and scalable).
•	Database: 
o	Relational: PostgreSQL (best for structured data like tasks, budgets, roles).
o	NoSQL (optional for flexibility): MongoDB (for unstructured data like notifications or logs).
•	Authentication: 
o	JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure session management.
o	Passport.js for OAuth SSO.
•	Role Management: CASL or custom middleware.
DevOps & Deployment:
•	Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, S3) or alternatives like Vercel/Netlify for frontend and DigitalOcean/Render for backend.
•	CI/CD: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.
•	Containerization: Docker for consistency across environments.
•	Monitoring: Sentry (error tracking) and Prometheus/Grafana (performance monitoring).
Other Tools:
•	Version Control: Git + GitHub/GitLab.
•	Task Management: Jira or Trello.
•	Testing: 
o	Unit: Jest (frontend and backend).
o	E2E: Cypress.

3. Development Plan
Phase 1: Planning & Setup
1.	Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders.
2.	Design database schema (users, roles, tasks, goals, budgets, etc.).
3.	Create wireframes and prototypes for the UI.
Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization
1.	Implement user registration and login with password hashing (bcrypt).
2.	Integrate OAuth (e.g., Google Workspace for company accounts).
3.	Develop role-based access control middleware.
Phase 3: Goal Management
1.	Backend: 
o	Create APIs to add, update, delete, and fetch goals.
o	Associate goals with departments and budgets.
2.	Frontend: 
o	Create goal creation forms.
o	Display goals in a list with filters.
o	Add progress visualization.
Phase 4: Task Management
1.	Backend: 
o	Build task CRUD APIs.
o	Integrate tasks with goals and employees.
2.	Frontend: 
o	Develop task creation and assignment UI.
o	Implement task progress tracking.
Phase 5: Budget Tracking
1.	Backend: 
o	Add APIs to manage budgets for each goal.
o	Calculate remaining and utilized budgets.
2.	Frontend: 
o	Display budget utilization in charts.
Phase 6: Notifications
1.	Implement server-side job scheduler (e.g., Node-cron) for alerts.
2.	Send email or push notifications for deadlines and overspending.
Phase 7: Analytics & Dashboard
1.	Backend: 
o	Aggregate data for charts and summaries.
2.	Frontend: 
o	Develop interactive dashboards with analytics.
Phase 8: Testing & Optimization
1.	Test all APIs and UI components.
2.	Optimize database queries and front-end performance.
3.	Conduct security audits.
Phase 9: Deployment
1.	Set up environments (staging and production).
2.	Deploy the application.
3.	Train users and provide documentation.
